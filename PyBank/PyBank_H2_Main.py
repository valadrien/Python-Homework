'''Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:â€¨
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
